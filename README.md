# TScript
This is the reference implementation of the TScript ("teaching-script")
programming language.

## Getting Started
TScript comes as a single html file. It does not require installation.
Simply open the file in a modern browser and you are ready to go. For
testing simply click the following link:
[distribution/index.html](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/distribution/index.html).
For more serious use it is recommended to store the page in your local
file system &mdash; simply use "save page as" (or similar) in your
browser.

The above page contains a complete integrated development environment
(IDE). You can start programming straight away in the source code editor
on the left. Documentation is also built-in - just click the
Documentation button on the right of the toolbar.

## Hello World
The famous hello world program is a one-liner in TScript:
```
print("Hello World");
```
For proper example code have a look at the [examples](examples)
directory. There is a whole battery of unit tests in the file
[source/unittest.html](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/source/unittest.html).
