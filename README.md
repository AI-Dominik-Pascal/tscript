# TScript
This is the reference implementation of the TScript ("teaching-script") programming language.

## Getting Started
TScript comes as a single html file. It does not require installation.
Simply open the file in a modern browser and you are ready to go. The
file can be stored in your local file system. The file you need is
[distribution/index.html](distribution/index.html).

Opening index.html provides you with a complete integrated development
environment (IDE). You can start programming straight away in the code
editor on the left. Documentation is also built-in - just click the
Documentation button on the right of the toolbar.

## Hello World
The famous hello world program is a one-liner in TScript:
```
print("Hello World");
```
For proper example code have a look at the [examples](examples)
directory. There is a whole battery of unit tests in the file
[source/unittests.html](source/unittests.html).
