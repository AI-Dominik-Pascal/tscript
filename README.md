# TScript
This is the reference implementation of the TScript ("teaching-script")
programming language.

## Getting Started
TScript comes as a single html file. It does not require installation.
Simply open the file in a modern browser and you are ready to go.
[Click here for a quick test.](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/distribution/index.html)
For more serious use it is recommended to store the page in your local
file system &mdash; use "save page as" (or similar) in your browser.

TScript comes with a complete integrated development environment (IDE).
You can start programming straight away in the source code editor on
the left. Documentation is also built-in - try the Documentation button
on the right of the toolbar.

## Example Programs
In TScript, "hello world" is a one-liner:
```
print("Hello World");
```
For proper example code have a look at the [examples](examples)
directory.

## Testing
If something does not work as expected then please run the
[unit tests](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/source/unittest.html)
in your browser. If a test should fail then please
[report a bug](https://github.com/TGlas/tscript/issues).
